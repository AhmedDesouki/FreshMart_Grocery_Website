# FreshMart_Grocery_Website
Project idea: grocery online shopping The main objective of this project is to manage the grocery, products, users, prices, orders, and stock. This website will have 2 users (Admin and End-user). The End-user will use the website to sign up, login, and browse through the products to buy. The end-user will have the privilege of showing their shopping cart to view the items they added and manage his account. The admin will have the privilege to login, add products, update the prices, and view customer information.
